TOPIC : Tea
I am planning to create a project that is mainly about Producing different types of Teas and selling to the customers. There are many different factories that 
produces teas.So I am going to automate this factories with my project. Of course project may not include all the scenarios 
that factories have but I will include Opp concepts.

MODELS :
There will be one BaseClass -> Bevarage that has name, price, and quantity fields in it.
There will also be my other models like GreenTea, BlackTea, OolongTea, and HerbalTea which implements the BaseClass.
Each this class will have their own specific fields also like flavor , content , origin_country

SERVICES :
There will be either Abstract class or Interface(actually Interface is also a way to implement abstraction in OOP).

Abstract class will have methods that many/all factories will implement Like
Produce(int TeaCount) (this method is run by ADMIN who has admin role in the program,

PackageTea() -> There will be 2 or more methods for Packaging :
For example . Package(int TeaCount) that package all the teas into Fixed -predefined boxes, 
Package(int TeaCount, int BoxCount) thak package all the teas into given amount of boxes . So here is Encapsulation concept is used, having more form with the same name of method. 

Order(int TeaCount,string email, string address ) (this is for user/ customer) (when there is enough tea in the store , it is delivered and 
an email is sent to the customer telling that your order is on the way. Payment is done when the order is delivered by cash)

Info() -> there will be info about the tea(price,content,flavor)



FACTORY Design Pattern or Factory Method:

As All/many factories work probably the same , i am going to use Factory design pattern, All factories implement AbstractServiceClass
and in each Tea Factory , class behaves differently.


GIT:
All changes will be committed into github, i will try to work with branches and issues and pull requests.


TESTING:

I will write unit test for my services.

There will be ONE default ADMIN user in the system registered!
I am also planning to register a user/customer. There might be register/login services so that user can enter the program with token !
It is not All, i will try to add some feature as i go . Some great ideas may come while i am in the project.
Basically I will try to include All opp concepts , write unit test, work with git and implement design pattern and so on.
